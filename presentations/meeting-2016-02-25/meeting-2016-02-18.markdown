# [Major DNS Security Flaw: CVE-2015-7547]
* http://dankaminsky.com/2016/02/20/skeleton/
* TL;DR: passing too long of an address into glibc can cause a DDoS error. 
* Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the (1) send_dg and (2) send_vc functions in the libresolv library in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.23 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted DNS response that triggers a call to the getaddrinfo function with the AF_UNSPEC or AF_INET6 address family, related to performing "dual A/AAAA DNS queries" and the libnss_dns.so.2 NSS module.
